This is my way of saying thanks to him for putting in the effort to create and share high quality content"

    "Over the years I've learned something about important about myself. I can be influenced pretty easily by others around me. Although this might seem like a bad thing at first, it is also probably my best trait. It has allowed me to stay open minded and learn new skills, put myself outside my comfort zone and really get entrenched in new ideas. Most recently I've been allowing Ali Abdaal to influence me by applying the techniques he talks about in his videos. Hopefully I can keep it going but the initial results are really promising, I'm more productive, create more, and finally do things I've been putting off for years! I can only recommend you watch his stuff and who knows, maybe it will do the same for you."
