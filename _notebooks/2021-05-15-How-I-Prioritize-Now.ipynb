    "The first step is to identify and understand when and why you procrastinate. The key objective here is to identify the most important tasks you should be focusing on. These are usually things that you've wanted to do for many years (like start a blog) but you've always managed to convince yourself you'll do it later or you're not ready yet. This is fear!

    "The highlight of the day is 1 objective you set for the day which is the only thing you need to get done for that day. The problem with a to-do list is we almost never manage to do everything on the list. The power of choosing only **1 task that needs to be completed** is that it immediately helps you prioritize what is really important because you only choose 1 thing.\n",
