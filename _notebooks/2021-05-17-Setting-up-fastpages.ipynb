    "Although these guides on [introducing fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html#Setting-Up-Fastpages) and in particular [setting up](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setup-instructions) will probably be more than sufficient for most people. I wanted to write my own version because I had some additional tips that I found useful while learning to use this platform.\n",
