            "title": "How I Prioritize and beat procrastination",
            "content": "About . Ever find yourself knowing you should be doing something but constantly putting it off? This is called procrastination and it&#39;s a problem plaguing everyone. Why exactly are humans so bad at doing what they know they are supposed to be doing? Well, it comes down to fear. Fear of failing, fear of putting in effort, fear of exposing yourself. . I am writing this post to outline how I managed to get over this fear and finally start doing the things I&#39;ve been putting off for years. . . How I stopped procrastinating . My road to solving this for myself comes from a combining of a few techniques I&#39;ve picked up from Ali Abdaal&#39;s videos. . Identify what you long for . The first step is to identify and understand when and why you procrastinate. The key objective here is to identify the most important tasks you should be focusing on. These are usually things that you&#39;ve wanted to do for many years (like start a blog) but you&#39;ve always managed to convince yourself you&#39;ll do it later or you&#39;re not ready yet. This is fear! This video from Ali Abdaal is a great summary: . How I Beat procrastination: . Make it your highlight of the day . The highlight of the day is 1 objective you set for the day which is the only thing you need to get done for that day. The problem with a to-do list is we almost never manage to do everything on the list. The power of choosing only 1 task that needs to be completed is that it immediately helps you prioritize what is really important because you only choose 1 thing. . So after identifying the tasks you procrastinate in step 1, step 2 is to make it your highlight of the day. . If it&#39;s something that can&#39;t be done in a day, you might want to break it down into smaller tasks. Keeping with the example of starting a blog, the first task (or highlight of the day) is to setup a website. The second task might be to write 1 post (or even just write for 2 hours). . I&#39;ve also found some success in not breaking it down, don&#39;t be scared to make your highlight of the day an impossible task, attempting to do the impossible in a day can have some great results. Reach for the stars and you might touch the sky! . Block time in your day . The last step is to use time-blocking to make sure I actually set aside time for doing the highlight of the day. Just listing you should do something is not enough. By making a calendar entry we remind ourselves to do something, or as Ali puts it, we use the calendar as our lash. . Some other useful tips . The above mentioned points are not the only useful tips when prioritizing your day. In particular the idea of - Hell yeah or no - is also something I&#39;m trying to follow. I strongly encourage you check out this video for more: . How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips . Thanks for reading. I hope some of these tips help you too! .",

            "content": "About . This post is about my struggle with getting myself to create more and consume less. Throughout, I&#39;ll be sharing some amazing videos I&#39;ve been watching on YouTube. These videos are from one of my new favorite YouTube content creators, Ali Abdaal, his videos helped me finally decide to start my blogging journey. . . Creation vs. Consumption . What is the difference? . These are 2 very broad terms, let&#39;s look at some examples: . Create Consume Content . write | read | books, blogs, articles | . speak, sing | listen | podcasts, songs | . act | watch | films | . build | use | applications | . My relationship with creation and consumption . I spend a lot of time (80%) consuming and a comparatively a small amount of time (20%) creating. For a while now I&#39;ve been trying to think of ways in which I could change this. It wasn&#39;t until recently that I&#39;ve finally made some progress by setting up this blog. . My hope is that this post might help you make the same transition. I would like to start by convincing you why creation is so important. . Why you should create more . Most of the points I&#39;ve raised here are extracted from this video from Ali Abdaal. . How Writing Online Made me a Millionaire . Express / Know yourself . When you are doing something like writing a blog you are also getting to know yourself, your inner thoughts and ideas are expressed on paper. It is a time in which you find out what you have to say to the world, sometimes even surprising yourself. Perhaps it can even be compared to meditation or praying. . Add value to the world . Why are we alive if not to add new things to the world. Imagine having to learn math without a book, writing allows us to speed up knowledge transfer to future generations. The best thing about the internet is that you are now able to share your ideas everywhere and with everyone! . Meet new people online . Sharing your interests online could lead to making unexpected friends in every part of the world. Personally, I believe the only way for long term sustained world peace is a deep integration and understanding of all cultures around the world. . Monetize . Another amazing motivator and reason for creating things is money. The ability to sell your content is definitely not easy but it&#39;s better having tried and failed than never having tried at all. . Posting your knowledge online can often lead to employment opportunities and a nice salary bump! . The internet, and particularly platforms like YouTube, Skillshare, Medium and others make it easier than ever to create passive income streams for retirement. Don&#39;t believe me? Check out this video from Ali for a real world example: . 9 Passive Income Ideas - How I Make $27k per Week . and many others advantages . Still not convinced? Go check out this post by Rachel Thomas, she knows a lot more than me: https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045 . How to get started . For me the hardest part in getting started was two fold: . I didn&#39;t know what I could possibly write about. I&#39;m still figuring this one out. For now I&#39;m planning to simply document what I&#39;m doing on a daily basis to get myself comfortable writing regularly. | My only advice is to not make it into a big thing. Start small and iterate. | Just start writing! | . | I didn&#39;t know which platform to use to get started. Here, fastpages came to my rescue. I&#39;ll be following up this post a tutorial on how to setup your own blog for free and in less than 5 min using fastpages. | Another option is use platforms like Ghost or Squarespace. These might be better options for normal (non-data science) people who don&#39;t need to write about math. | . | . How To Set Up A Website - EVERYTHING You Need To Know . Final thoughts . Over the years I&#39;ve learned something important about myself. I can be influenced pretty easily by others around me. Although this might seem like a bad thing at first, it is also probably my best trait. It has allowed me to stay open minded and learn new skills, put myself outside my comfort zone and really get entrenched in new ideas. Most recently I&#39;ve been allowing Ali Abdaal to influence me by applying the techniques he talks about in his videos. Hopefully I can keep it going but the initial results are really promising, I&#39;m more productive, create more, and finally do things I&#39;ve been putting off for years! I can only recommend you watch his stuff and who knows, maybe it will do the same for you. .",
